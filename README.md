# mpg Predictive Model Application
Simple predictive model for gas consumption

This repo contains the necessary files and supporting documentation for running an application that based on user´s input (horsepower, weight, and type of transmission) provides an estimation of the given car´s gas consumption (mpg).

The prediction is based on a simple linear model with interactions. The data `mtcars` comes with the `datasets` package and according to documentation in R, "[... it has been] extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models)".

The shiny application can be found in the following [link](https://cpatinof.shinyapps.io/shinyApp)
